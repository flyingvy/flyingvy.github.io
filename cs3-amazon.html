                <p>For the Design for Digital Environments course, our project focused on an existing mobile application. Our goal was to analyze the app and improve the user experience by providing UX/UI design solutions based on feedback from extensive usability testing. The app that my group chose was the Amazon shopping app for its popularity. Our first step was to do a heuristics study of the app to find out pain points that could be addressed in a redesign.</p>
                <p>My group members were Nathan Hollaway and Jasmine Loyal.</p>

                            <p>Michelle opens the app to begin searching for a new bed for her oldest child. She has set aside the time required to do a little research prior to purchasing. Upon opening the app, she heads straight for the search bar. She inputs “boys twin bed” and briefly scrolls through the initial results. She decides to filter the list by color and material. She views the product page for the first result and scrolls to the “compare” module. One of the other beds in the list isn’t a contender. She wants to compare. She cannot perform the action</p>

                            <p>Mason notices that he needs to order more water filters. He grabs his phone and gets on Amazon. Initially he clicks on “Buy Again”, but what he is looking for isn’t listed. He goes to his previously placed orders.  He checks the filter option, but decides he doesn’t remember when the last time he made the purchase. He decides to go back and do a search instead and gets no results because of a misspelling. He is annoyed that the search didn’t recognize his intention. He corrects it and finds the item</p>

Going through Home and Garden, he finds the top ranked lawn mowers. Once there he can’t compare them to each other nor do any filtering to match his specifications</p>
