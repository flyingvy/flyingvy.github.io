						<h2>Methodology</h2>
                        <p>Eight areas of focus were identified and incorporated into the design of a consistent set of user tasks to test the usability of each institution’s Discovery Services. Research teams tested each of the tasks on the targeted institution’s system, making slight modifications as needed to create a consistent challenge for users. For example, a book title that was unavailable at the target institution might be substituted for one that was.</p>
                        <p>Subjects were recruited from a pool of current students enrolled in the institution, and offered an incentive of a $25 Fandango gift card upon completion of the testing session. Sessions were conducted in succession at the Usability Lab at the University of Baltimore, utilizing the Tobii Eye Tracking system.  Each testing session lasted approximately 1 hour and began with a pre-screening questionnaire to identify the subject’s current level of experience with the library’s systems.</p>

						<h2>User Profiles</h2>
                        <p>Four undergraduate students from the University of Maryland College Park were recruited on a first come, first serve basis to test the WorldCat Discovery systems. Subjects came from a diverse set of degree programs and previous experiences with library systems. Recruitment methods were focused solely on identifying undergraduate students (the institution’s target population for this study).</p>

                                        <p>WorldCat’s main search box is ideally placed on the homepage to support strong visibility. However, half of the subjects were unaware that it was for all source types, and only one subject utilized the “Databases” tab. Revising the language used and tab structure should help to alleviate these deficiencies.</p>

                                        <p>Most users utilized both the library and undergraduate resources as starting points when they did not know where to begin their searches. Students were able to find instructions on how to access certain items or tasks through links provided from the library homepage. However, users struggled to access their accounts specifically and the “My Accounts” contents were not easily accessible.</p>

                                        <p>WorldCat discovery provides search recommendations, both in drop down forms as well as with spelling recommendations. While this can provide benefits to users during their research tasks, several issues were identified with the current implementation of these tools which led to inadvertent modifications to search terms.</p>

                                        <p>Search results are displayed in a list with pertinent information, and local sources appear to be prioritized over sources from other USMAI institutions. However, inconsistencies in the displayed fields, iconography, and summaries frustrated users when assessing potential resources.</p>

                                        <p>Students are provided multiple methods to obtain sources throughout the library system including online access, interlibrary loans, and local requests. Testing indicated a strong preference to materials with online access, and as a result several were unfamiliar with how to access resources via alternative methods. Reinforcing a consistent look and feel between these methods should support increased use of all types of resources.</p>
